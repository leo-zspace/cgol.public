# Code Samples

* Please have a look at this tiny example of how we like to write our code (<https://tinyurl.com/hashtable-c>). We nearly always work in C like this, and strive to produce work that is as straightforward as possible. We care about aesthetics, uniformity and syntactic safety.  But, we value simplicity and correctness above all. 

* Please provide any example(s) that make you proud (preferably in C).  We encourage sample code in the form of a git repo URL (or other equivalent VCS), but we'll also accept a zip archive if necessary. Send links or attachments to the zSpace System Software Team <system.software.jobs@zspace.com>.

# Conway's Game of Life (GoL)

* Please complete the following coding exercises:

  * [Exercise #1 - Trivial GoL](https://github.com/zspace/system.software.interview.gol.public/blob/master/GOL-trivial.md)
  
  * [Exercise #2 - Client/Server GoL](https://github.com/zspace/system.software.interview.gol.public/blob/master/GOL-client-server.md)

* There is no set time limit. One hour should suffice for the first problem, whereas the second might fill an afternoon. But, feel free to take as long as need to produce a quality result. 

* You can use any platform of your choice, e.g. Mac OS, Linux, Windows, etc.

* For reference we provide Windows [sample implementations](https://github.com/zspace/system.software.interview.gol.public/tree/master/bin) of all exercises.

* We would like you to consider the compactness of your binaries. These are our sample solution sizes:

* Note that we are aware of: https://github.com/duckythescientist/obfuscatedLife/blob/original/life.c and https://github.com/konmik/Life. However, you should strive for *humanly* *readable* C code.

* Please do not submit code with TAB formatting -- spaces only.

* Please submit your source code, makefile/project/solution files, and/or binaries in a zip archive, as a GitHub link, or as a bare source file as instructed by the respective exercise page.

We look forward to reading your code:
