# Conway's Game of Life (GoL)

* Please complete the following coding exercises:

  * [Exercise #1 - Trivial GoL](https://github.com/zspace/system.software.interview.gol.public/blob/master/GOL-trivial.md)
  
  * [Exercise #2 - Client/Server GoL](https://github.com/zspace/system.software.interview.gol.public/blob/master/GOL-client-server.md)

* There is no set time limit. One hour should suffice for the first problem, whereas the second might fill an afternoon. But, feel free to take as long as need to produce a quality result. 

* You can use any platform of your choice, e.g. Mac OS, Linux, Windows, etc.

* For reference we provide Windows [sample implementations](https://github.com/zspace/system.software.interview.gol.public/tree/master/bin) of all exercises.

* We would like you to consider the compactness of your binaries. These are our sample solution sizes:

* Note that we are aware of: https://github.com/duckythescientist/obfuscatedLife/blob/original/life.c and https://github.com/konmik/Life. However, you should strive for *humanly* *readable* C code.

* Please submit your source code, makefile/project/solution files, and binaries in a zip archive, or as a GitHub link.

* Thanks!
